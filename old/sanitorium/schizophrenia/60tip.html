      <div align=center>By Rex Dickens or the NAMI Sibling and Adult Children 
        Network.</div>
      <br>
      <br>
      If you have a family member with neurobiological disorder ("<b>NBD</b>", 
      formerly known as mental illness), remember these points: <br>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. You <b>cannot cure</b> a mental disorder for a family member. </p>
        <p>2. Despite your efforts, <b>symptoms may get worse</b>, or may improve. 
        </p>
        <p>3. If you <b>feel</b> much <b>resentment</b>, you are giving too much. 
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>4. It is <b>as hard </b>for the individual to accept the disorder <b>as 
          it is</b> for other family members. </p>
        <p>5. Acceptance of the disorder by all concerned may be helpful, but 
          not necessary. </p>
        <p>6. A <b>delusion will not go away by reasoning </b>and therefore needs 
          no discussion. </p>
        <p>7. You may learn something about yourself as you learn about a family 
          member's mental disorder. </p>
        <p>8. Separate the person from the disorder. <b>Love the person</b>, even 
          if you hate the disorder. </p>
        <p>9. Separate medication side effects from the disorder/person. </p>
        <p>10. It is not OK for you to be neglected. You have needs &amp; wants 
          too. </p>
        <p>11. Your chances of getting mental illness as a sibling or adult child 
          of someone with NBD are 10-14%. If you are older than 30, they are negligible 
          for schizophrenia. </p>
        <p>12. Your children's chances are approximately 2-4%, compared to the 
          general population of 1%. </p>
        <p>13. The illness of a family member is <b>nothing to be ashamed of</b>. 
          Reality is that you may encounter discrimination from an apprehensive 
          public. </p>
        <p>14. <b>No one is to blame</b>. </p>
        <p>15. Don't forget your sense of humor. </p>
        <p>16. It may be necessary to renegotiate your emotional relationship. 
        </p>
        <p>17. It may be necessary to revise your expectations. </p>
        <p>18. Success for each individual may be different. </p>
        <p>19. <b>Acknowledge the</b> remarkable <b>courage </b>your family member 
          may show dealing with a mental disorder. </p>
        <p>20.Your family member is <b>entitled to his own life journey</b>, as 
          you are. </p>
        <p>21. Survival-oriented response is often to shut down your emotional 
          life. Resist this. </p>
        <p>22. Inability to talk about feelings may leave you stuck or frozen. 
        </p>
        <p>23. The f<b>amily relationships may be in disarray</b> in the confusion 
          around the mental disorder. </p>
        <p>24. Generally, those closest in sibling order and gender become emotionally 
          enmeshed, while those further out become estranged. </p>
        <p>25. Grief issues for siblings are about what you had and lost. For 
          adult children the issues are about what you never had. </p>
        <p>26. After denial, sadness, and anger comes acceptance. The addition 
          of understanding yields compassion. </p>
        <p>27. The mental illnesses, like other diseases, are a part of the varied 
          fabric of life. </p>
        <p>28. Shed neurotic suffering and embrace real suffering. </p>
        <p>29. The mental illnesses are not on a continuum with mental health. 
          <b>Mental illness is a biological brain disease.</b> </p>
        <p>30. <b>It is absurd to believe you may correct a physical illness such 
          as diabetes,</b> the schizophrenias, or manic-depression <b>with talk</b>, 
          although addressing social complications may be helpful. </p>
        <p>31. <b>Symptoms may change</b> over time while the underlying disorder 
          remains. </p>
        <p>32. The disorder<b> may be periodic</b>, with times of improvement 
          and deterioration, independent of your hopes or actions. </p>
        <p>33. You should <b>request </b>the diagnosis and its <b>explanation 
          from professionals</b>. </p>
        <p>34. Schizophrenia may be a class of disorders rather than a single 
          disorder. </p>
        <p>35. Identical diagnoses does not mean identical causes, courses, or 
          symptoms. </p>
        <p>36. Strange behavior is symptom of the disorder. <b>Don't take it personally</b>. 
        </p>
        <p>37. You have a right to assure your personal safety. </p>
        <p>38. Don't shoulder the whole responsibility for your mentally disordered 
          relative. </p>
        <p>39. You are not a paid professional case worker. Work with them about 
          your concerns. </p>
        <p>Maintain your role as the sibling, child, or parent of the individual. 
          <b>Don't change your role</b>. </p>
        <p>40. Mental health professionals, family members, &amp; the disordered 
          all have ups and downs when dealing with a mental disorder. </p>
        <p>41. Forgive yourself and others for mistakes made. </p>
        <p>42. Mental health professionals have varied degrees of competence. 
        </p>
        <p>43. If you can't care for yourself, you can't care for another. </p>
        <p>44. You may eventually forgive your member for having MI. </p>
        <p>45. The needs of the ill person do not necessarily always come first. 
        </p>
        <p>46. It is important to have boundaries and set clear limits. </p>
        <p>47. Most modern researchers favor a genetic, biochemical (perhaps interuteral), 
          or viral basis. Each individual case may be one, a combination, or none 
          of the above. </p>
        <p><b>Genetic predisposition may result from a varied single gene or a 
          combination. </b> </p>
        <p>48. <b>Learn more about mental disorders.</b> Read some of <a href="/media/">our 
          recommended books</a> like Surviving Schizophrenia: A Family Manual 
          by Dr. E. Fuller Torrey and Overcoming Depression by Dr. Demitris Papolos 
          and J. Papolos. </p>
        <p>49. From Surviving Schizophrenia: "Schizophrenia randomly selects personality 
          types, and families should remember that persons who were lazy, manipulative, 
          or narcisstic before they got sick are likely to remain so as schizophrenic." 
          And, "As a general rule, I believe that most persons with schizophrenia 
          do better living somewhere other than home. If a person does live at 
          home, two things are essential--solitude and structure." And, "In general, 
          treat the ill family member with dignity as a person, albeit with a 
          brain disease." And, "Make communication brief, concise, clear and unambiguous." 
        </p>
        <p>50. It may be therapeutic to you to help others if you cannot help 
          your family member. </p>
        <p>51. Recognizing that a person has limited capabilities should not mean 
          that you expect nothing of them. </p>
        <p>52.<b> Don't be afraid to ask your family member if he is thinking 
          about hurting himself. </b> </p>
        <p><b>A suicide rate of 10% is based on it happening to real people. Your 
          own relative could be one. Discuss it to avoid it. </b> </p>
        <p>53. Mental disorders affect more than the afflicted. </p>
        <p>54. Your conflicted relationship may spill over into your relationships 
          with others. You may unconsciously reenact the conflicted relationship. 
        </p>
        <p>55. It is natural to experience a cauldron of emotions such as grief, 
          guilt, fear, anger, sadness, hurt, confusion, etc. You, not the ill 
          member, are responsible for your own feelings. </p>
        <p>56. Eventually you may see the silver lining in the storm clouds: increased 
          awareness, sensitivity, receptivity, compassion, maturity and become 
          less judgmental, self-centered. </p>
        <p>57. Allow family members to maintain denial of the illness if they 
          need it. Seek out others whom you can talk to. </p>
        <p>58. <b>You are not alone.</b> Sharing your thoughts and feelings with 
          others in a support group is helpful and enlightening for many. </p>
        <p>59. The mental disorder of a family member is an emotional trauma for 
          you. You pay a price if you do not receive support and help. </p>
        <p>60. Support AMI/FAMI and the search for a cure! </p>

      <div align=center><b><font size=+1>TIPS FOR HANDLING A CRISIS</font></b></div>
      <br>
      <p><font size=-1>(The following is from the Washington State AMI via AMI 
        of Hamilton County, Ohio. It has suggestions on how to handle a family 
        member who is becoming psychotic. Note that each person is an individual 
        and these suggestions may not apply to all. )</font></p>
      <p>There are some actions that can diminish or avoid disaster. You need 
        to reverse any escalation of the psychotic symptoms and provide immediate 
        protection and support to the MI person. Remember: <b>Things always go 
        better if you speak softly and in simple sentences.</b> </p>
      <p>Seldom will a person suddenly lose total control of thoughts, feelings, 
        and behavior. <b>Warning signs include: sleeplessness, ritualistic preoccupation 
        with certain activities, suspiciousness, unpredictable outbursts, etc.</b> 
        During these early stages a full blow crisis can sometimes be averted. 
        If the person has ceased taking medications, encourage a visit to the 
        physician. The more psychotic the patient, the less likely you'll succeed. 
        Trust your feelings. If you are frightened, take immediate action.</p>
      <p>Your task is to help the patient regain control. <b>Do nothing to agitate 
        the scene.</b> The patient is probably terrified by the subjective experience 
        of loss of control over thoughts and feelings. The "voices" may be giving 
        life-threatening commands: messages may be coming from the light fixtures; 
        the room may be filled with poisonous fumes; snakes may be crawling on 
        the window. Accept the fact that the patient is in an "altered reality 
        state" and may "act out" the hallucination, e.g. shatter the window to 
        destroy the snakes. It is imperative that you remain calm. If you are 
        alone, call someone to stay with you until professional help arrives.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The patient may have to be hospitalized. Try to convince him or her to 
        go voluntarily; <b>avoid patronizing or authoritative statements.</b> 
        If necessary, take steps to start the involuntary treatment process. If 
        indicated, call the police but instruct them not to brandish any weapons. 
        Explain that your relative or friend is mentally ill and that you have 
        called them for help. </p>
      <br>
      <b>DON'T THREATEN-</b>This may be interpreted as a power play and increase 
      fear or prompt assaultive behavior.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DON'T SHOUT</b>-If the person isn't listening, other "voices" are probably 
      interfering. <br>
      <br>
      <b>DON'T CRITICIZE</b>-It will make matters worse; it can't make things 
      better. <br>
      <br>
      <b>DON'T SQUABBLE WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS</b> over "best stratiegies" 
      or allocations of blame. This is no time to prove a point. <br>
      <br>
      <b>DON'T BAIT THE PATIENT</b>-Into acting out wild threats; the consequences 
      could be tragic. <br>
      <br>
      <b>DON'T STAND OVER THE PATIENT</b>-If he is seated. Instead, seat yourself 
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>AVOID CONTINUOUS EYE CONTACT OR TOUCHING</b> <br>
      <br>
      <b>COMPLY WITH REQUESTS</b>-That are not endangering or beyond reason. This 
      gives the patient the opportunity to feel somewhat "In control.<br>
      " <br>
      <b>DON'T BLOCK THE DOORWAY</b>-But keep yourself between the patient and 
      an exit. <br>

      <p>Following are some more Tips for Coping with someone who has a neurobiological 
        disorder. Some are from AMI/APRIL, some are by Dr. Gil Tunnell at Bellevue, 
        and some are from Marion Burns at Kings Park. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. <b>Go Slow.</b> Recovery takes time. Rest is important. Things will 
          get better in their own time.</p>
        <p>2.<b> Less Stimulation.</b> Keep it cool. Enthusiasm is normal. Tone 
          it down! Disagreement is normal. Tone it down, too!</p>
        <p>3. <b>Give 'em space.</b> Time out is important for everyone. It's 
          okay to offer. It's okay to refuse.</p>
        <p>4. Set limits and have structure. <b>Everyone needs to know what the 
          rules are</b>. A few good rules keep things calmer.</p>
        <p>5. <b>Let some things slide. </b>Ignore what you can't change. Don't 
          ignore violence!</p>
        <p>6. <b>Keep it simple.</b> Say what you have to say clearly, calmly 
          and positively.</p>
        <p>7.<b> See that Dr's. orders are followed.</b> Take medications as they 
          are prescribed. Take only medication that is prescribed.</p>
        <p>8. <b>Socialize and carry on business as usual.</b> Reestablish family 
          routines quickly as possible. Stay in touch with family and friends. 
          Take vacations.</p>
        <p>9. <b>No street drugs or alcohol. </b>They make symptoms worse. </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p>10. Pick up on early signs of relapse.<b> Note changes such as inappropriate 
          fear, annoyance, etc.</b></p>
        <p>11. <b>Solve problems step by step.</b> Make changes gradually. Work 
          on one thing at a time.</p>
        <p>12.<b> Lower expectations, temporarily. </b>Use a personal yardstick. 
          Compare this month to last month rather than last year or next year.month 
          rather than last year or next year. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <br>
      <hr width="75%" color=#c0c0c0 size=5>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>How to Avoid Relapses</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>1. Provide a structured, <b><u><i>supportive, tolerant, low stress environment</i></u></b>. 
        Set clear expectations of behavior and review them carefully. Give your 
        relative clearly defined tasks, but keep expectations moderate. Learn 
        to expect and tolerate some degree of deviant behavior. Have a set routine 
        in the household with regular hours for meals, tasks, and other activities. 
      </p>
      <p> <b>2. </b><b><u><i>Keep home atmosphere as calm as possible.</i> </u></b>Each 
        family member should speak for themselves and be allowed to finish what 
        they are saying. Don't "mind-read" what another family member is thinking 
        or feeling. Allow each family member to handle their own communication 
        with another family member. Don't ask a brother to tell a sister. Do it 
        yourself. Remind each other of that. </p>
      <p>3. <b><u><i>Do not get emotionally overinvolved with your relative</i>.</u></b> 
        Give them psychological and physical space (ex. let them go to their room 
        or take a walk). Keep criticism and over enthusiastic praise to a minimum. 
        Don't be overly intrusive of your ill relative's thoughts or feelings, 
        like saying, "you wouldn't like that kind of work" or "you really don't 
        like so and so". Expect that they may rest or pace a lot, and indulge 
        in unusual but harmless behavior. Allow this. Adopt an attitude of "Benign 
        indifference" and a decreased focus on the details of the ill person's 
        behavior. </p>
      <p>4. <b><u><i>Put limits on hostile or bizarre behavior.</i></u></b> Often 
        deviant behavior or delusional verbalizations will decrease if he is told, 
        in a non-emotional way, that it is not appropriate. If your relative has 
        paranoid ideas (like they feel people are out to hurt them) don't argue 
        them out of it. Just sympathize, saying it must be upsetting to feel like 
        that. Be very clear but calm about the consequences of continuing with 
        disruptive, hostile, or aggressive behavior.</p>
      <p>5. Help in providing stimulation and treatment. <b><u><i>Recognize changes 
        in the person that signal they are ready for more indepence, or need more 
        help if doing less well.</i></u></b> Inform doctors, therapists, etc. 
        of changes in person's condition. Provide stimulation without stress. 
        Visits, outings, etc. are good only if the ill person is interested and 
        can function acceptably. Discovering this is a trial and error procedure. 
        Families can help explore available community programs. Become a knowledgeble 
        aggressive advocate and your relative will get better care and do better.</p>
      <p>6. <b><u><i>Take care of yourself.</i></u></b> Families must take care 
        of themselves. Share your frustrations with others. Join AMI/FAMI Support 
        Groups. Enjoy outside interests, too. Increase your outside social contacts. 
        Make sure all family members have their needs met, not just the sick person.</p>
      <p>7. Remember: The future is unpredictable and <b><u><i>stay with the present. 
        </i></u></b>Reduce expectations for a rapid recovery. Reduce pressure 
        on the patient for performance. Modify overall expectations and strike 
        a reasonable balance between realism and hope.</p>

      <div align=center><b>Communication Skills</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>Effective communication with schizophrenic patients is particularly important 
        because they are so easily overwhelmed by the external environment. Skillful 
        communication can make an enormous difference in the ability of patients 
        and families to resolve the problems of daily living.</p>
      <br>
      <div align=center> 
        <p>Good communication involves: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Knowing <b>when</b> to communicate 
          <li>2. Knowing <b>what </b>to communicate 
          <li>3. Knowing <b>how</b> to communicate. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>When to Communicate</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>Don't discuss something important when you are angry or upset. It's hard 
        to think clearly, listen well, and focus on constructive solutions. Before 
        talking to your relative, take as much time as you need to calm down.</p>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>What to Communicate About</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>Since schiophrenia is a serious disorder that affects not only the patient 
        but others around the patient, there are usually several problem areas 
        that family members want to address. Bringing up several problems at once 
        will overwhelm your relative, so it's best to select one problem at a 
        time. Choose one problem area that is really important, then focus on 
        a specific behavior you'd like your relative to change. For ex., say, 
        "John, please stop playing your radio so loudly after 10 p.m." Don't say, 
        "John, you're too noisy at night."</p>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>How to communicate</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>Communication has two levels, verbal and nonverbal. Verbal communication 
        is the what you actually say. Keep all your verbal communication simple, 
        brief, and specific. Nonverbal communication refers to how you say it--your 
        tone of voice, posture, eye contact, facial expression, and physical distance 
        between speakers. The nonverbal "message" that comes across is often more 
        important than the the verbal message.</p>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>Guidelines</b> for non-verbal communication:</div>
      <br>
      1. Stand close to your relative, but don't crowd his/her personal space.<br>
      2. Convey interest, concern and alertness through your body posture and 
      facial expression. <br>
      3, Maintain eye contact with your relative.<br>
      4. Speak calmly and clearly.<br>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>Expressing positive feelings.</b></div>
      <br>
      1. Look at the person. <br>
      2. Say exactly what the person did that pleased you. <br>
      3. Tell the person how their behavior made you feel. (Bad ex.: "You are 
      nice to have around the house." Good ex.: "I like it when you do a nice 
      job cleaning the kitchen").<br>
      <div align=center><b>Making a positive request.</b></div>
      <br>
      1. Look at the person. <br>
      2. Say exactly what you would like the person to do. <br>
      3. Tell how it would make you feel. <br>
      4. Use phrases like "I would like you to...." or "I would really appreciate 
      it if you would....."<br>
      <div align=center><b>Expressing negative feelings.</b></div>
      <br>
      Look at the person. Say exactly what the person did that upset you. <br>
      Tell the person how it made you feel. <br>
      Suggest how the person might prevent this from happening in the future. 
      (Bad ex. "You are a frightening person." Good ex. "I get very nervous when 
      you pace around the room.")<br>
      <div align=center>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Active listening</b></p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div align=center>1. Look at the speaker. <br>
        2. Attend to what is said. <br>
        3. Nod head, say, "Uh-huh". <br>

      <br>
      <div align=center><b>BOUNDARIES</b></div>
      <br>
      <div align=center>or "Why doing less for your relative shouldn't make you 
        feel bad."</div>
      <br>
      <p>As a caregiver for someone with a neurobiological disorder ("NBD" formerly 
        known as 'mental' illness) you may think: <br>
        "Since the other person needs so much done, I'll do absolutely everything 
        I can for as long as I can."</p>
      <br>
      <div align=center>...or</div>
      <br>
      <p>"Because the other person is so needy, I will do whatever they want, 
        whenever they want, for as long as they want." </p>
      <p>However admirable these thoughts appear, they can create problems for 
        your caregiving. Here are two reminders.</p>
      <p>* You need to establish boundaries for your own good.</p>
      <p>Yes, it's true - the other needs you. Yes, you can help, and yes, you 
        may find meaning in doing that. But, no, you don't have to do it all. 
        And, no, you don't have to do it to your own detriment.</p>
      <p>Being always with another and doing constantly for another allows you 
        no time to meet your own needs. And you have very important needs to be 
        met. If you're not careful, you'll soon be on your way to exhaustion and 
        burnout.</p>
      <p>Some boundaries for you to set are physical. Some things are simply too 
        strenuous for you to do. Some hours are too long for you to keep. Some 
        chores you cannot continue to perform with relief.</p>
      <p>Other boundaries for you to set are emotional. If you identify too completely 
        with the other's pain or fear or other strong emotions, you will be in 
        danger of making them your own. Your responsibility is to handle only 
        one person's feelings - yours.</p>
      <p>Remember also that setting limits to your caregiving will make room for 
        other caregivers. Family members and friends may wish to share in these 
        duties. It's one way they can cope with what has happened, and one way 
        they can show their love. </p>
      <p>* You need to establish boundaries for the other person's good.</p>
      <p>One way you can respect the other is to give them their own space. They 
        need their privacy just as before - perhaps to read or mediate or write. 
        They may wish to look out the window and do nothing at all. If you do 
        not provide for this solitary time, the one in your care may not have 
        the strength or the heart to do so.</p>
      <p>The other person needs the freedom to do things on their own as a matter 
        of self- esteem, and perhaps for continued recovery. If you insist on 
        doing too much, the other has too little opportunity to flex their muscles. 
        And there are several kinds of muscles they may need to flex.</p>
      <p>Good boundaries give the other this added benefit: you can be a more 
        objective presence in their life. Your insight can be more accurate and 
        your feedback can be more useful.</p>
      <p>All in all, establishing boundaries is one of the most thoughtful things 
        you can do. It can even draw you closer together.</p>

      <p>World Schizophrenia Fellowship Pamphlet #17 -</p>
      <div align=center><b><font size=+1>SCHIZOPHRENIA: HOW SHOULD ONE BEHAVE? 
        </font></b></div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>It may seem odd to ask "How should one behave towards a person with schizophrenia 
        or allied disorder." However, most people do not understand what it is 
        that makes it difficult for people with the disorder to communicate. The 
        general public feels embarrassed and sometimes frightened to hold a conversation 
        with a person who has mental illness. This pamphlet tries to give some 
        pointers as to how to behave and is for families and for the general public.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We have learned that we need to speak slowly and clearly to persons with 
        schizophrenia: to make the sentences short so that they are not too complicated; 
        to wait to make sure that what we are saying is reaching the person. </p>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>Why is this technique useful?</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>A person with schizophrenia replies: "My concentration often floats in 
        and out so that I only hear part of a sentence. Maybe I will miss two 
        or three words. This will make it very difficult for me to understand. 
        Recently I went on a family outing. There were other families there and 
        I could hear everything that everyone was saying to everyone else. The 
        sound and all the people moving about came in on me so much I began to 
        get quite frightened. I was agitated and irritated at the same time. I 
        felt I wanted to defend myself in some way. My dad took me to a quiet 
        place where we sat and had a cup of tea. We didn't talk about it. We just 
        sat and drank our tea and I began to feel less threatened."</p>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>Structure and Instructions</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>We have been advised that people with schizophrenia need structure in 
        their lives; that routines are comforting and predictable and therefore 
        useful to someone whose medical condition often makes life unpredictable. 
        It is suggested that it is useful to help them set up a schedule and a 
        few tasks to accomplish. at certain times of the day or week.</p>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>Is it possible to achieve this?</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>Some people with schizophrenia are very disabled or become disabled from 
        time to time. It is not always possible for them to follow a schedule, 
        although it is beneficial to try to maintain a definite routine. However, 
        when your relative/ your client/ friend attempts a task but isn't able 
        to complete it or does it wrong it is not at all helpful to say things 
        like: "Can't you get anything right?" or "Let me do it!" even when you 
        are very frustrated. Break tasks into simple components to create the 
        possibility of success, and to encourage the feeling of being useful. 
        Give only one instruction at a time.</p>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>Maintaining Equilibrium</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>Sometimes you may feel you are walking on broken glass when your relative 
        or someone you know is having a particularly difficult time. At that time 
        you have to summon up all your energy so that you can maintain their trust 
        while at the same time maintaining equilibrium at home. Here are some 
        ideas towards that goal. Many of these behaviours should also be adopted 
        by the general public. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be Friendly 
        <li>Be Accepting 
        <li>Be Encouraging 
        <li>Make time to listen 
        <li>Include them 
        <li>Treat them with respect </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>Avoid the following: </b></div>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Being <b>patronizing</b> 
        <li>Being <b>critical </b> 
        <li><b>Pushing them</b> into situations they are not comfortable with 
        <li>Being <b>gloomy</b> 
        <li><b>Arguing</b> with them, or with others while they are present 
        <li>Giving them a <b>lecture</b> or talking too much 
        <li>Getting yourself into difficult situations with them. </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Sooner or later when a person has Sz a crisis will occur. When this happens 
        there are some things you can do to reduce or avoid the potential for 
        disaster. Here are a few pointers:</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Remember that you <b>cannot reason with acute psychosis</b>. 
        <li>Remember that the <b>person may be terrified by his/her own feeling</b>s 
          of loss of control. 
        <li><b>Do not express irritation or ange</b>r. 
        <li>Don't <b>shout.</b> 
        <li>Don't use <b>sarcasm</b> as a weapon. 
        <li><b>Decrease distractions</b>:turn off TV, Radio, dishwasher, etc. 
        <li>Ask any casual <b>visitors to leave</b> - the fewer people the better. 
        <li><b>Avoid</b> direct continuous <b>eye contac</b>t. 
        <li><b>Avoid touchin</b>g the person. 
        <li><b>Sit down </b>and ask the person to sit down also. </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>When people move</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>Often, a relative or friend will move or change his circumstances in 
        some way without informing anyone. Social workers and other mental illness 
        professionals are inclined to tell parents to "Let him take responsibility 
        for doing this," or "It will be a learning experience for her." This type 
        of advice indicates to us that many people in the helping professions 
        do not understand the nature of schizophrenia. Our advice differs.</p>
      <p>We know from experience that many persons with Sz are often unable to 
        take responsibility for informing others about such matters. If we leave 
        them to do so we are likely to end up dealing with the much more complicated 
        mess that will have to be sorted out when the consequences of this lack 
        of action come about. Examples are: pension/social assistance cheque fails 
        to arrive and the person is cut off from benefits; bank communications, 
        bills, etc are not received and not paid. Rent is neglected; possessions 
        are left behind; premises are left uncleaned. Our advice is look after 
        these matters if you suspect your friend/ relative won't.</p>
      <p>People like to feel that they are in control of their lives. Sometimes 
        it is difficult to persuade someone with schizophrenia to do what is best 
        for them. Thus it is useful to offer a choice. "Will you take a walk now 
        or after lunch", might be a way to suggest a walk, a shower, or any activity 
        that you may feel useful or enjoyable. People with schizophrenia often 
        have feelings that change very frequently, so that what someone may refuse 
        at this moment he/she may agree to do later in the day/week.</p>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>Going to the Doctor</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>A lot of people of my acquaintance complain that all psychiatrists are 
        good for is prescribing pills or giving injections ? and perhaps that's 
        truSome people seem to want to go to the psychiatrist and get some real 
        counselling. They'd like to talk about their housing and they'd like to 
        talk about what the psychiatrist can do to help them get back to work 
        or at least what would be their strengths if they tried. I don't know 
        whether anyone has a psychiatrist who will help like this. Usually it's 
        See the social worker?. But one of the men I see when I go for my appointment 
        says the social worker is never in when he comes for his appointment. 
        The trouble with me is that I have such high anxiety just walking in the 
        out-patient door that by the time the doctor says Come in?, all I want 
        to do is get out of there! So it's a case of him saying How've you been?? 
        and me saying Fine? and then responding that way to every question he 
        asks me. He's trying to help but I'm about to explode. So I guess all 
        my psychiatrist is good for is prescribing pills.?</p>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>Holiday time</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>I dread holiday times when families are all supposed to get together, 
        eat and drink and generally enjoy each others? company. For me, times 
        like these bring back feelings of disappointment, resentment, sadness 
        and a whole host of other emotions. Christmas, for example, has not been 
        a good time for me or the family for many years. There were times my brother 
        was in hospital, times he was home but barely stable, times he had to 
        be taken to hospital during the holiday, times the police came. If I dread 
        it, what does it mean to him? When he thinks a lot is expected of him, 
        he usually handles it well for a few hours, but after that he crashes? 
        - I mean he retreats to his inner self, or he gets extremely agitated. 
        Last year each visiting family member took my brother aside for a mini-visit, 
        a one on one chat and that seemed to work a little. At least he knew everyone 
        cared. But when it came to the big dinner he disappeared to his room. 
        He just cannot process a lot of noise, people,snatches of conversation 
        - it's just too much for him.? </p>
      <br>
      <div align=center><b>Do you help frail old ladies across the street?</b></div>
      <br>
      <p>Use some of that attitude in rethinking your treatment and interaction 
        with a person who suffers from schizophrenia who may live near you. This 
        doesn't mean that you need to be overly friendly, but don't ignore them, 
        engage them in conversation, but don't be intrusive. People with Sz, like 
        a physically frail person, cannot defend themselves as well as a person 
        in full possession of physical powers. They are also often on heavy doses 
        of medication which may slur their speech or make them react slowly. Take 
        into account that sometimes the person may be anxious and may withdraw. 
        Let people withdraw, but leave the door open. Maybe ask them to visit
